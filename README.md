##Synopsis  
SGD for Matrix Factorization on Spark. Implement Large-Scale Matrix Factorization with Distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent (DSGD-MF) in Spark

##Dataset  
Data used is a subsample of the Netflix dataset for the experimental evaluation. This is a
very popular recommendation dataset that has ratings of movies by Netflix users. The sub-
sampled dataset is available at http://ridcully.cs.uga.edu/assignment4/nf_subsample.csv
